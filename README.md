# HealthSim
HealthSim is a modular C++ project that builds a simplified digital twin of a patient to forecast the effects of lifestyle choices-such as diet, exercise, and medication, on long-term health. The app models vital organs, chronic conditions, and lifestyle factors, and simulates their interaction using OOP principles.
